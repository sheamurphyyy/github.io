            <p>4. According to a 2002 NIST study what % of software came in significantly late, over budget, or was canceled? Two out of three</p>
                <p>5. Who wrote the 1987 essay entitled “No Silver Bullet?”  Frederick P. Brooks, Jr</p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>1. What roles in the Chandler project did Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli hold. 
        Michael Toy, John Anderson, Ted Burgess, Mitchell Kapor, and Lou Montulli were programmers in the Chandler project.</p>
     
    <p>2. What is “Bugzilla?
        "Bugzilla" is an interface of coded bugs, an individual programmer would estimate how long a specific task (bug) would take to solve.</p>
     
    <p>3. What is OSAF? 
        "OSAF" is a public, Open Source Application Foundation. </p>
     
    <p>4. What is the projects name?
        The project's name was The Chandler Project.</p>
     
    <p>5. What will the software do?
        The idea for the software was to manage personal information of the client. </p>
     
    <p>6. What is Toy’s keyword for “black hole” bugs?
        Toy's keyword for "black hole" bugs was "a developers nightmare". </p>
     
    <p>7. What scared Toy so much about Bug 44?
        Toy was scared about Bug 44 because it was an internal problem with the programming language they were all using. This meant that they either had to wait for the developers to develop more code to fix the problem, or they had to figure out a way to fix it themselves.</p>
     
    <p>8. What did Toy refer to as a “snake?” 
        Toy referred to a problem that held importance as a "snake".</p>
     
    <p>9. In the software world, what does “slippage” mean?
        "Slippage" is a term used in the software-world when estimating the time a project takes to develop after it's due date (since projects tend to carry through their deadlines)</p>
     
    <p>10. Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for what software project?
        Fredrick Brooks was a programming manager for the IBM system.</p>
     
    <p>11. What is Brooks's Law? 
        Brook's Law was created as a means to express that bringing more people onto a project that is already late makes is later.</p>
     
    <p>12. Brooks found what % of project time was spent writing code?
        Brooks found that one-sixth of a projects time should be spent on writing code.</p>
     
    <p>13. Brooks found what % of project time was for testing and fixing bugs?
        Brooks stated and theorized that about one-half of the programmers' schedule should be spent on testing and fixing bugs.</p>
     
    <p>14. Brooks observed that the unit of effort named “man-month” only applied under what conditions?
        Brooks found that the unit of effort called "main-month" was only applicable for a task that can be partitioned without communication among one-another.</p>
     
    <p>15. What is the difference between source code and the program you install (.exe) on your computer?
        Source code is the means a program is written by the specific programmers. Once the company publishes and distributes the code, you (as a user) installs it with a compiler which protects the code for the company and yourself.</p>
     
    <p>16. What is the one “article of faith” that all “open source” or “free” software advocates share?
        An "open source" advocate would share the same feeling "that software that software that canyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time".</p>
     
    <p>17. What is the difference between a “good” programmer and a “great” programmer?
        The difference between a good programmer and a great programmer is a subtle one: a good programmer knows how to write code, a great programmer knows how to rewrite code.</p>
     
    <p>18. Eric Raymond’s book “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” made a distinction between two important project development ideas, briefly contrast them.
        Eric Raymond's book "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" made a distinction between two important development ideas
    The Cathedral type, which encompasses carefully creating a program all in one go, with no betas.
    The Bazzar type involves a pace of development that is released often. </p>
     
    <p>19. Has “open source” software project development refuted Brooks’s “mythical man-month” concerns?
        "Open source" project development has proposed a different approach to "mythical-man month".</p>
     
    <p>20. What was Andy Hertzfeld’s input when the Chandler project appeared to have stalled?
        When the Chandler project appeared to stall, Andy Hertzfeld said "The key is getting exciting work going; the rest of it will take care of itself."</p>
    
       
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
    <p>1.Linus Torvalds used a “science” and “witchcraft” analogy referring to software, explain. Linus Torvalds used a science and witchcraft analogy to refer to software because a witchcraft person has to guard their secrets. And any other large cooperation would hide their code/software, too.</p>
    
    <p>2.People often refer to starting their computer as “booting” their computer. What was the origin of this term? It originated from the term bootstrap, referring to the paradox of how a computer can now run without the software already on.</p>
    
    <p>3. Where was the graphical user interface (GUI) developed? Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center</p>
   
    <p>4.List three software project “train wrecks.”

    Because its typical for coders to get it wrong the first time around</p>
    
    <p>6. What is a “core” dump? Why the use of the word core? When a computer stops everything and prints out a report of everything that went wrong. The word core is used akin to the brain or central part of the processing system.</p>
    
    <p>7.Rather than writing program statements in binary code, 110101110  1001101111, programmers developed a shorthand language called what?
     Assembly, which is essentially shorthand for programmers. </p>
    
    <p>8.Adding layers of abstraction, new programming languages were created: Lisp, Cobol, Algol, Basic. Fortran was the first widely used. What kind of program converted Fortran to binary?
    A compiler that was programmed to convert Fortran to binary.</p>
    
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
    <p>1. What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?

    <p>2. What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to? 
    The ability to find and create an addition to already made code</p>

    <p>3. Give one reason why the Lego Hypothesis seems to not work so well.
    All code was different and therefore it had a very hard time</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
    <p>1. What is the three-way trade-off that many software projects struggle to overcome?
    Companies want to adopttwo of the following when putting out a program in concerns to it's features and aspects: Fast. Cheap. or Good.</p>

    <p>1. What is term “edge cases” referring to in software development?
    The rare occurrence of something going wrong while saving a file of code</p>

    <p>2. Summarize briefly Linus Torvalds advice about “large projects” give in 2004
    Large projects are inefficient, however, if the earmarked project is not too big, there is always a middle ground.</p> 
    
<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
    <p>1. Briefly describe Hungarian notation
     In Hungarian notation, the programmer appends a prefix to every variable name that gives anyone reading the code important clues about what sort of variable it is</p>
    
     <p>2. What does the author state is the “...single most challenging demand of software development.”
    “Communicating abstractions unambiguously—from programmer to machine, from programmer to programmer, and from program to user”</p>

    "When people ask for numbers that far out, the traditional thing that engineers do, is make them up."</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
    <p>1.Structured programming evolved to address what programming practice?
    It was practiced for the development of an indexing system.</p>
    
    <p>2. Was structured programming a solution to the problem of software development?
